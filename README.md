# Mailbox
Have you ever, even once in awhile, been in possession of a letter that you need to mail? You know where the post office is, but that's like 5 minutes away and you're lazy. While driving around town, you *know* you've seen a mailbox somewhere, but you can't remember where.

Enter Mailbox.

The idea is to be able to open a map and, based on your position, show the nearest mailboxes to you. The thing is, I am but a mere data scientist and have no clue how to write a phone app, so we're going to take this journey together.
